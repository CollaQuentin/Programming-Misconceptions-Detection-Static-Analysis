Readability | Terrible due to the different ways of assigning variables in Python, needing to keep track of all assigned variables but also of the way they are used (more than once, or once in a loop that is not the loop in which they were defined, ...). | Long and complex pattern using multiple lookahead | The most readable out of the three checkers for this misconception, requires to verify that there is an assignment somewhere for each variable that we check to prevent testing builtin functions/methods. |
Writability | Quite complicated due to all the details to take in account. Since there's no easy way to store a "Variable" object using flake8, the best solution was to create our own, storing the position where the variable is assigned, the amount of time it was used, its scope, etc. | Complex to write and to design. The best solution I found was to look for assignments where the target is not used twice, meaning it doesn't appear between two other letters (`\w`) twice. This condition was required to prevent seeing `print` as a use of a variable `i`. | Simple to write, eventhough it requires the use of `exists()` and to double check the locations in which the variables are defined and use (to make sure that we're not considering a variable to be used if another file uses another variable with a similar name). |
