# AssignCompares

## Description

Students confuse the assignment operator (`=`) with the equality operator (`==`).

## Symptoms

We're looking for conditions in which two values are compared using the assignment operator (`=`).

## Theorical examples

```py
if a = 3:
    print("a is 3")
```

```py
while condition = True:
    print("The condition is True")
```
